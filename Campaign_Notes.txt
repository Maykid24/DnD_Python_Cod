Questions to ask prior to Starting the Session:
    - Is it still heavily raining/windy outside?
        If yes:
            Are they at disadvantage for movement due to wind? (Half Speed / Difficult Terrain)
            Are they at disadvantage for Perception with rain pelting their face?

    - Do we see the imps fanning out across all areas?
    - Did we see anything coming out of the cave as we are running?
    - Once we get back to the trail, do we see Imps still flying around spreading out or are they staying close to the
        cave?
        - From what we saw on this trail, is there any other trails that we could see that are further away from the cave?
        - Do we ultimately say "Screw this!" and go back to the city, telling Larenhale you have a Devil issue that
            needs an army to deal with it.
