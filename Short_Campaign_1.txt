        The Secret Celery - Owner = Ardian Loft (Gnome - Quiet / Short and to the point)
        The Pink Raven - Owner = Almon Adhorn (Elf - Has a Pink Raven sitting on his shoulder / Russian Accent)

If group goes directly to the Tavern not hearing what Deidara stated: Perception Check (DC 15)
    Tavern 1:
        The Mysterious Pub
            Individuals speak about the riches in a mountain not too far away, about a days travel
            Lies inside the mountain a mound of treasures no one could ever imagine
            Continues discussing that the mountain is abandoned but no one was able to get to the treasure
                - Dragon Mountain (Ancient Dragon)
                Ancient Dragon gives them a deal that if they bring the Merc Group leader to him alive or dead, the
                Dragon will spare their lives along with everyone in Olsa Thalor

    Tavern 2:
        The Secret Celery
            Genuine nice, gambling happens all the time and drinking games happen all the time

    Tavern 3:
        The Pink Raven
            Bounty office, mercenary hang out / soldier hang out


If the group asks for directions to Deidara's family:
    They get directions very easily if asking anyone on the street or guards
    They meet the Hibana family which is different, if the group provides the object that Deidara presents they sit down
        and have a conversation about what exactly happened
    They state that the real group responsible for it has never been truly found but, they believe it's a group that lives
        to the east somewhere on an island (Land of Coal), about half a day to the docks and another half day by boat to the island
            - Big Baddies and massive amount of Corruption along the way
                (Need to fine tune this of what they would be facing)
                Humans, Trolls, Creatures?

End goal, looking for the Merc group to destroy/kill/bring to justice
