__________________________
*** 3/6/2022 Session ***

Connor
    - Leaves during the middle of the night

Marcus
    - Has a vivid dream of being shown the way to the mysterious mountain, going into the mountain itself and seeing
        all the astonishing layout of the mountain and how complex it truly is. Going through the mountain and the maze
        going into the gold/jewels piles finds a jewel that is unlike anything he's ever seen. As he walks up and begins
        to start putting his hand out to grab the jewel his mind races back through the mountain and back to the city
        as he jerks awake in the morning

Koshka
    - Has a vivid dream of being shown the same exact way to the mysterious mountain as if she is with Marcus in his
        dream. Koshka looks over to see Marcus looking to start grabbing a jewel that is shining in various different
        colors. As this happens the pile of gold and jewels begins to move and Koshka see's a massive nostril and see's
        an eye open underneath the pile of gold and jewels looking directly at Koshka. The Ancient Gold Dragon speaks to
        Koshka directly in her mind in a very rough and carried voice:
            "I see you little one, you cannot hide... I see you..."
        Koshka's mind races and flys out of the mountain back to the city and abruptly wakes up.

Ragnus
    - Mind cannot stop thinking about earlier events of the day that he was shown about his religion, not able to escape
        it. His mind races as if he's being lifted out of his body upwards through the ceiling and notices a familiar
        figure that is pointing North, saying nothing. If Ragnus asks anything the familiar figure not only points North,
        looks North.
            If Ragnus looks North:
                Ragnus's mind fly's forward through the trails moving North to the Empire almost the same route that
                was shown earlier that day by Ilmater. But, prior to getting to the edge of the trees he goes off the
                trail going West. On the way he see's elves running through the trees and a mound of smoke appearing in
                the near distance. As he gets there he see's an Elven village being pillaged and burned to the ground.
                He says different religion flags and finally see's the Ilmater flag flying as a few of the followers
                kill Elves that are standing and fighting.
                As he's watching there is an Eagle that fly's right in front of him, noticing a message on the Eagle
                flying straight for the city at an extremely fast pace.
                    If Ragnus looks at the Eagle, Ragnus follows the Eagle at an extreme speed back to the City.
                    Following the same route that was to the mine that they took earlier, but then going down into the
                    depths of the city itself. As Ragnus goes through the depths of the city starts to realize this city
                    is far more massive than he imagined, over 14 layers of city buildings.
                        Once the Eagle gets to the final layer, Ragnus looks out to see over 150,000 Elven troops all
                        training and geared for war. If Ragnus speaks Elven:
                            He notices one Elf grab the message and hand it over to what looks to be the commander.
                            The commander reads the message and states:
                                "Sound the drums and the horns!" (All the Elven troops stand at attention all in
                                incredible formation)
                                "The Empire has attacked one of our villages for the last time, we march for war!!"
                            Ragnus hears behind him different kind of noise and see's another 50,000 Elven calvary all
                            on massive Elks. Ragnus see's the army begin marching up the layers of the city and his mind
                            warps back to the religion building where he prayed to talk to the Ilmater. The Ilmater is
                            waiting for Ragnus inside the building and states:
                                "You are now starting to see these followers in this realm are not the same from the realm
                                you come from. The Empire is empowered by these fanatics, they think this city only has
                                a few thousand soldiers as an army. But, what they don't realize is they have awoken a
                                sleeping giant. This world has forgotten the strength of Olsa Thalor, they have not seen
                                this army in over three generations."
                            Ilmater allows for Ragnus to ask questions and answers them as best as he can. Once the
                            questions are done the mind starts to warp back and can hear the marching, the drums, the
                            horns of the now awoken giant. Ragnus slowly starts to wake up...

The group all awakes
    - They don't hear the birds chirping, they don't hear people downstairs talking and having breakfast
    - If they wake up quietly, roll perception:
        DC 15
            If they get above DC 15 they start to hear the footsteps of marching and the slow beat of drums
            If they get below DC 15 they hear nothing as almost if it's an erie quiet in the city
                As time moves on the DC becomes lower, by 9AM the army will be marching in front of the Tavern in full
                force

When the group gets down to the main part of the Tavern Sandra is waiting for them with a Barbarian
    - Introduces the Barbarian to the group and states that they could help going to the Land of Coal and dealing with
        the Merc Group
    - Also confirms that the city is going to war with the Empire for multiple attacks on the Elven villages outside
        Olsa Thalor
