	- Misty Lands (Green Portal)
		- Main Goal:
			- To defeat the minions of the Sorcerer
			- Defeat the Sorcerer if found

		- Land of the mist, cannot see beyond 60 feet during the day / during the night turns into a fog
			- Depending on the sun / moon brightness will dictate if the 60 feet
				- 11 or higher sun / moon is bright --> if lower then faded brightness
					- If bright able to see 30 feet further than usual
				- Roll second d20 for clouds in the sun / moon
					- 11 or higher sun / moon is out
						- Able to see 60 feet
						- Less than 11 only able to see 30 feet in any direction
		- In buildings able to see throughout the entire building as mist cannot access the buildings

		- 2 Orange Portals

			Riddle:
				- I can see light, but I'm filled with darkness. I usually only have one entrance and one exit. I'm usually located deep within the mountains and sometimes in random spots. What am I?
					- A: A Cave

			- 1. The location of the minions, number of minions and a weakness about the minions
				- Location: Walk 300ft to the north
							Run 100ft to the east
							Head north until you reach the cave
				- Number of Minions:
							30 Minions
				- Weakness:
							They usually sleep during the night and only have two sentries watching, one at the main entrance of the cave, the other down into the cave about 100ft
							You might be able to collapse the cave entirely with destroying specific pillars
			- Another Orange Portal is to the east roughly 1 Mile, in the forest at the base of the largest tree

			Riddle:
				- The leaves blow in the wind, the clouds becomes darkness. There is a bright light in an instant, that causes great fire. What am I?
					- A: Lightning / Thunder

			- 2. The location of the Sorcerer and a weakness
				- Location: Walk 500ft to the west
							Walk 500ft to the north
							Run 350ft to the south
							Walk 100ft to the north
				- Weakness:
							Earth/Dirt - Cover yourself in it, otherwise the battle ahead will hurt... and some may never come back
				If you haven't found it yet, there is another Orange portal roughly 1 mile due west. Before you reach the mountains and the entrance into the mountain pass. I highly suggest going there first before proceeding to the Sorcerer... It will be in your best benefit to do so.
